"""Static site generator for the Base91z project website.

The site has no content of its own: every page, the landing page included, is
rendered from a Markdown file the repository already ships -- the README, the
specification, the benchmark report, the changelog -- so the website cannot
drift from the repository. Repository-relative links in those files are
rewritten either to the corresponding generated page or to an absolute
github.com URL.

This generator is Base85N's, adapted: the page list, the identity and the
footer are this project's, and the machinery -- specification discovery, the
index checks, GitHub-compatible heading anchors, link rewriting -- is
unchanged, because both repositories publish the same shape of document.

Where a source carries something that only makes sense on GitHub -- the badge
row at the top of the README, its link *to* this site -- a filter in
``SOURCE_FILTERS`` removes it. Filters only ever remove; nothing on this site
is written twice.

Usage::

    pip install -r site/requirements.txt
    python3 site/build.py [--output DIR] [--serve]

The default output directory is ``site/_build``, which is git-ignored.
