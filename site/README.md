# Project website

The site published at <https://keywan-ghadami.github.io/Base91z/> is
generated from this directory by [`build.py`](build.py) and deployed by
[`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) on every push to
`main` that touches the site, the specification, the benchmark report, the
changelog, the Impressum or the README.

There is deliberately **no content here at all**. Every page, the landing page
included, is rendered from a Markdown file that already lives in the repository
— the project README, the specification, the benchmark results, the changelog,
the Impressum — so the website cannot drift out of sync with the repository.
Repository-relative links in those files are rewritten either to the
corresponding generated page or to an absolute `github.com` URL, and heading
anchors are slugified the way GitHub does it, so a link written for one works on
the other.

The generator is [Base85N's](https://github.com/keywan-ghadami/base85n), adapted.
The page list, the identity and the footer are this project's; the machinery is
unchanged, because both repositories publish the same shape of document and one
of them should not have a second, slightly different version of this.

## Layout

- `build.py` — the generator: page list, HTML template, link rewriting.
- `check_links.py` — verifies every internal link and `#anchor` in the built
  site resolves. CI fails the build if one does not.
- `assets/style.css` — the entire stylesheet. No framework, no external fonts,
  no JavaScript; the site works with light and dark colour schemes.
- `requirements.txt` — pinned build dependency (python-markdown).

`build.py` also holds `SOURCE_FILTERS`, which removes the parts of a source that
only make sense on GitHub: the README's badge rows. Filters only ever *remove* —
nothing on this site is written twice.

## Building locally

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r site/requirements.txt
python3 site/build.py --serve      # builds into site/_build, serves on :8000
python3 site/check_links.py        # optional: same check CI runs
```

`site/_build/` is git-ignored.

## Adding a page

Add a `Page(...)` entry to `PAGES` in `build.py`. If the new page should be
reachable from an existing Markdown link target, add that target to
`PATH_TO_PAGE` as well, so links to it are rewritten to the generated page
instead of falling through to a `github.com` URL.

## Where the specification pages come from

`spec/` holds exactly one document — the current specification — and
`spec/history/` holds every superseded one. That split is what a first-time
reader meets: one specification in the navigation, and a history area one link
away. The build enforces it, and fails if `spec/` ever holds more than one.

`build.py` discovers `Base91z-v*.md` in both directories, reads the version,
status and date out of the metadata table at the top of each one, sorts them,
and generates a page per version. The current one keeps its own status, every
older one is labelled *superseded by* the version that followed it, and the
version in the footer of every page is the current one. A document and its page
therefore cannot disagree about what version it is.

What is not derived is either directory's index, because both are read on GitHub
as well and generating them would mean generating repository documents. Instead
the build *checks* them: a specification with no entry in its directory's index,
or an entry pointing at a file that is not there, fails the build with the
offending name. Links that leave a directory (`../`) are not counted, so the
history index can point at the current specification — which it should.

Retiring a version is therefore two moves: `git mv` the document into
`spec/history/`, and move its entry from `spec/README.md` to
`spec/history/README.md`. Nothing here changes.
